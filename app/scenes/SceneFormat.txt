A definition of how a scene file should be written

Scenes are defined as XML files where each object has a corresponding XML tag.

Pine Engine has 4 primitive object types:
    - <Scene>   -> Scene
    - <Ent>     -> Entity
    - <Cmp>     -> Component
    - <Sys>     -> System


Some of these objects can have children:
    Scene consist of:
    - Entities
    - Systems

    Entities consist of:
    - Components
    - Child Entities

    Components and Systems can't have children.


The XML structure is:
    <Object variable1="val" variable2="val" ...>

        <ChildObject variable1="val" ...>
            ...                                 children here
        </ChildObject>

        <ChildObject variable1="val" ... />     use this if object has no children
    </Object>

Required variables for every object:
    <Scene>
    - name: string

    <Ent>
    None

    <Cmp>
    - type: string
    + optional type specific variables

    <Sys>
    - type: string
    + optional type specific variables
