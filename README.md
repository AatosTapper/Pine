# Pine 
*work in progress*
## a 2D Game engine for Lua

Pine is designed to be as **simple and elegant** as possible while allowing maximum flexibility, freedom and power entirely within Lua.

The goal is to provide the smallest possible API capable of building any game with an arbitary amount of complexity.
